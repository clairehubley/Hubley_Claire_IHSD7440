Claire Hubley Homework #3

General feedback:
- Fantastic job! Only issues I saw were with calculating the proprotions and standard errors for your totals in each table (bottom row)
- I've included in the word doc example code you could use if you want to recalculate these, and then your design effects.

Initial grade= 33/35
